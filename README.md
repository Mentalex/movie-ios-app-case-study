# Movie iOS App Case Study

## Introduction
Project to build an iOS app base on Movie App Prototype Design.

## Design
I chose [Movie App Design](https://dribbble.com/shots/18632188-Movie-App) from [Purrweb UI/UX Studio on Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/purrwebui).

## Data Source
I decided to use the [The Movie DB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/) as remote data source.
